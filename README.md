# Welcome to the Udacity-Bike Share Data Project !

Over the past month, I learned a lot about Python programming language, PANDAS and NumPY libraries. This is the first assignment in UDACITY leaning shcolership.
I would like to send my pleasure to FWD community. They give me the chance to open a new gate.

 ## Bike Share System

In the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

## The Proposed Solution 

In the proposed solution, you can find to the script to collect usage patterns about bike share system in major cities in the United States. the main large cities are: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Proposed solution composed of Python script. I used the shared template with helper file bikeshare.py, The three city dataset files is uploaded:

1. chicago.csv
1. new_york_city.csv
1. washington.csv

There is another file unit_test.py, it was for testing purpose only
